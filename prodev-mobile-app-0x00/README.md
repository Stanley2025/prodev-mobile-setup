# My First Mobile App - prodev-mobile-app-0x00

This document outlines the process of scaffolding my first mobile application using the Expo Router template.

## Scaffolding Steps

1.  **Cloned Repository:** Cloned the parent `prodev-mobile-setup` repository.
2.  **Initialized Expo Project:** Ran `npx create-expo-app@latest prodev-mobile-app-0x00` to create the project.
3.  **Modified the Home Screen:** Edited `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` to change the default text to "** First App Created**".
4.  **Ran the Application:** Started the development server using `npx expo start` to test the changes.
5.  **Reset the Project:** Ran `npm run reset-project` to reset the app structure.

## Observations from the `reset-project` Command

After running the `npm run reset-project` command, the following happened:

*   The original contents of the `app` directory were moved into a new `app-example` directory. This preserves the template code and my modifications for reference.
*   A new, minimal `app` directory was created, providing a clean slate to begin building the application from scratch.
